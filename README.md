## Customization

These configs reflect one person's preferences. Fork the repo and adapt anything to suit your own workflow - swap keybindings, change themes, adjust paths.

The agents and skills included here are a solid starting point, but the best ones you'll ever use are the ones you write yourself. Use the `skill-expert` and `agent-expert` agents to create your own, tailored to how you actually work.
